In order of importance...

* Add CMake support.

* Add unit tests.

* Test compilation on Linux (Eigen may not be happy with struct alignment in Node.h).

* Add QueryRay function.

* Remove public API dependency on Eigen.

* Remove dependency on stb_image... I.e. write basic .bmp IO code.

* Experiment with per-axis basis dimension increases and per-node splitting planes (whilst maintaining octree structure and query performance).
